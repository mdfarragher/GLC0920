    "# Assignment: Predict bike sharing demand in Washington DC\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you're going to build an app that can predict bike sharing demand in Washington DC.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bike-sharing system is a service in which bicycles are made available to individuals on a short term. Users borrow a bike from a dock and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Docks are bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve probably seen docks around town, they look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bike sharing rack](./assets/bikesharing.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike sharing companies try to even out supply by manually distributing bikes across town, but they need to know how many bikes will be in demand at any given time in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s give them a hand with a machine learning model!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to train a forest of regression decision trees on a dataset of bike sharing demand. Then you’ll use the fully-trained model to make a prediction for a given date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you will need is a data file with lots of bike sharing demand numbers. We are going to use the [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) from [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) in Metro DC. This dataset has 17,380 bike sharing records that span a 2-year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has already been downloaded and is available to your code as **bikedmand.csv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data File](./assets/data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a comma-separated file with 17 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instant: the record index\n",
    "* Date: the date of the observation\n",
    "* Season: the season (1 = springer, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter)\n",
    "* Year: the year of the observation (0 = 2011, 1 = 2012)\n",
    "* Month: the month of the observation ( 1 to 12)\n",
    "* Hour: the hour of the observation (0 to 23)\n",
    "* Holiday: if the date is a holiday or not\n",
    "* Weekday: the day of the week of the observation\n",
    "* WorkingDay: if the date is a working day\n",
    "* Weather: the weather during the observation (1 = clear, 2 = mist, 3 = light snow/rain, 4 = heavy rain)\n",
    "* Temperature : the normalized temperature in Celsius\n",
    "* ATemperature: the normalized feeling temperature in Celsius\n",
    "* Humidity: the normalized humidity\n",
    "* Windspeed: the normalized wind speed\n",
    "* Casual: the number of casual bike users at the time\n",
    "* Registered: the number of registered bike users at the time\n",
    "* Count: the total number of rental bikes in operation at the time\n",
    "\n",
    "You can ignore the record index, the date, and the number of casual and registered bikes, and use everything else as input features. The final column **Count** is the label you're trying to predict.\n",
