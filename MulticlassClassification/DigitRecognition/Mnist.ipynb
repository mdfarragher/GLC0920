    "# Assignment: Recognize handwritten digits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, You are going to build an app that recognizes handwritten digits from the famous MNIST machine learning dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MNIST digits](./assets/mnist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app must read these images of handwritten digits and correctly predict which digit is visible in each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem like an easy challenge, but look at this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Difficult MNIST digits](./assets/mnist_hard.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a couple of digits from the dataset. Are you able to identify each one? It probably won’t surprise you to hear that the human error rate on this exercise is around 2.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you will need for your app is a data file with images of handwritten digits. We will not use the original MNIST data because it's stored in a nonstandard binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll use these excellent [CSV files](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/) prepared by Daniel Dato on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training and testing files **mnist_train.csv** and **mnist_test.csv** have already been downloaded and are available to your code. There are 50,000 images in the training file and 10,000 in the test file. Each image is monochrome and resized to 28x28 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training file looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data file](./assets/datafile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a CSV file with 785 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first column contains the label. It tells us which one of the 10 possible digits is visible in the image.\n",
    "* The next 784 columns are the pixel intensity values (0..255) for each pixel in the image, counting from left to right and top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to build a multiclass classification machine learning model that reads in all 785 columns, and then makes a prediction for each digit in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get started\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started. You're going to install the following ML.NET packages:"
