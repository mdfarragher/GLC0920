    "# Assignment: Predict who survived the Titanic disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sinking Titanic](./assets/titanic.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you're going to build an app that can predict which Titanic passengers survived the disaster. You will use a decision tree classifier to make your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you will need for your app is the passenger manifest of the Titanic's last voyage. You will use the famous [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/sbaidachni/MLNETTitanic/tree/master/MLNetTitanic) which has data for a subset of 891 passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training and testing data files have already been downloaded and are available to your code as **test_data.csv** and **train_data.csv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data file looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training data](./assets/data.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a CSV file with 12 columns of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The passenger identifier\n",
    "* The label column containing ‘1’ if the passenger survived and ‘0’ if the passenger perished\n",
    "* The class of travel (1–3)\n",
    "* The name of the passenger\n",
    "* The gender of the passenger (‘male’ or ‘female’)\n",
    "* The age of the passenger, or ‘0’ if the age is unknown\n",
    "* The number of siblings and/or spouses aboard\n",
    "* The number of parents and/or children aboard\n",
    "* The ticket number\n",
    "* The fare paid\n",
    "* The cabin number\n",
    "* The port in which the passenger embarked\n",
    "\n",
    "The second column is the label: 0 means the passenger perished, and 1 means the passenger survived. All other columns are input features from the passenger manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're gooing to build a binary classification model that reads in all columns and then predicts for each passenger if he or she survived.\n",
