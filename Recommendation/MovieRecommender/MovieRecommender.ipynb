    "# Assignment: Recommend movies to film fans\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you're going to build a movie recommendation system that can recommend new movies to film fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you'll need is a data file with thousands of movies rated by many different users. The [MovieLens Project](https://movielens.org) has exactly what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data files **recommendation-movies.csv**, **recommendation-ratings-test.csv** and **recommendation-ratings-train.csv** have already been downloaded and are available to your code. There are 100,000 movie ratings in total with 99,980 set aside for training and 20 for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training and testing files are in CSV format and look like this:\n",
    "￼\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data File](./assets/data.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "* The ID of the user\n",
    "* The ID of the movie\n",
    "* The movie rating on a scale from 1–5\n",
    "* The timestamp of the rating\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also a movie dictionary in CSV format with all the movie IDs and titles:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data File](./assets/movies.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to build a data science model that reads in each user ID, movie ID, and rating, and then predicts the ratings each user would give for every movie in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a fully trained model, you can easily add a new user with a couple of favorite movies and then ask the model to generate predictions for any of the other movies in the dataset.\n",
